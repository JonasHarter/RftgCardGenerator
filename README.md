# Roll for the Galaxy Card Generator

A card generator for the Boardgame Roll for the Galaxy<br />
The intent was to replace the tiles in the game with cards.<br />

All images are AI generated with MidJourney.<br />
This uses flowRoot (from svg 1.2), so Inkscape is probably requried for png conversion.<br />
This uses the DM Serif font. It needs to be installed, so Inkscape can use it.<br />

# Ideas

- Support for locale specific text and images
- Automatically check for unused images
- Bigger text to fill space
- Center header vertically
- Backside for single sided cards
- Starting planets no A/B in id
- Improve centering & shape of cost and plus
