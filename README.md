# Roll for the Galaxy Card Generator

A card generator for the Boardgame Roll for the Galaxy
The intent was to replace the tiles in the game with cards.

All images are AI generated with MidJourney.

# TODO

recheck all texts

remove all alien pictures

improve centering of cost and plus
improve headertextshape

create html for printing

create cards via build action

phase icon for versetzen? Spiralpfeil

check for unused images

//remove shape from model: color means circle, otherwise rhombus
//Icons? -> too much work. not enough gain. Text is workds fine.

This uses flowRoot, so inkscape is requried for png conversion
