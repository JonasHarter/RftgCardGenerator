# Roll for the Galaxy Card Generator

A card generator for the Boardgame Roll for the Galaxy
The intent was to replace the tiles in the game with cards.

All images are AI generated with MidJourney.
This uses flowRoot (from svg 1.2), so inkscape is requried for png conversion
This uses the DM Serif font. It needs to be isntalled, so inkscape can use it.
